# clinical:example-plugin

This is an example plugin for Meteor on FHIR (and Symptomatic) that illustrates how to create a REST endpoint, database collection, server side publication, client side subscription, and a reactive user interface.  When implemented, you can ping the REST endpoint, and it will automatically update the user interface.  


#### Installation    

```bash
meteor add clinical:example-plugin
```
